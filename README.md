# Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System
Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System are becoming increasingly important in today's digital world, where
users share a lot of personal information and data with different applications and platforms. With
the rise of privacy concerns and data breaches, Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System are necessary to
ensure that users are in control of their data and that their privacy is protected.

In today's digital world, users share a lot of personal data on different platforms. With the rise of privacy concerns and data breaches, certain applications are required to ensure that the data is in control of its user and that its privacy is maintained.

### Traditional forms of identity management have several limitations and drawbacks such as -

<ul>
<li><h2>Privacy</h2>
Individuals often have to share sensitive personal data with third-party organizations putting their privacy at risk, as these organizations may not have adequate security measures in place to secure the data.
<li><h2>Security</h2>
These are vulnerable to security breaches and identity theft. A centralized authority or third-party that holds personal data can be a single point of failure, making it easier for attackers to gain access to large amounts of data.
<li><h2>Control</h2>
 Individuals often have limited control over their personal data. They may not be able to choose what data is collected, how it is used, or who has access to it.
<li><h2>Portability</h2>
They are difficult to be used across different platforms. For example, a driver's license issued in one state may not be recognized in another state.
</ul>

### SSI Management System addresses these issues by providing 
a user-centric approach to identity management. It puts data in control of its user, allows users to choose who has access to it, and ensures that the data is secure and tamper-proof. It also serves greater portability, as individuals can use their digital identity across different platforms.

SSI Management System uses Ethereum Blockchain Technology. In this application there are three different entities-Issuer, Holder and Verifier.
Issuers(any government entity) can issue the credentials of the holder with a unique wallet address of the Holder(citizen of any country) and Id. Holders can see their credentials by entering the Id. They can also share and revoke their credentials to any third party. Third parties can see the credentials of the holders if access is provided by the Holders by entering the Id of the Holder.
