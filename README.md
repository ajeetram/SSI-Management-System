# Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System
Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System are becoming increasingly important in today's digital world, where
users share a lot of personal information and data with different applications and platforms. With
the rise of privacy concerns and data breaches, Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System are necessary to
ensure that users are in control of their data and that their privacy is protected.

So, to overcome the above problems, I have built a Self-Sovereign-Identity-Management-System using Ethereum
Blockchain Technology. In this application there are three different entities-Issuer,Holder and
Verifier.

Issuers can issue the credentials of the holder with a unique wallet address of the holder and Id
number. Holders can see their credentials just by entering the Id number. Holders also can share
and unshare their credentials to any third party. Third parties can see the credentials of the
holders when access is provided by holders, just by entering the Id number of the holderâ€™s
credentials.
