# Consent-Based Data Management System
Consent-based applications are becoming increasingly important in today's digital world, where
users share a lot of personal information and data with different applications and platforms. With
the rise of privacy concerns and data breaches, consent-based applications are necessary to
ensure that users are in control of their data and that their privacy is protected.

So, to overcome the above problems, I have built a consent-based-application using Ethereum
Blockchain Technology. In this application there are three different entities-Issuer,Holder and
Verifier.

Issuers can issue the credentials of the holder with a unique wallet address of the holder and Id
number. Holders can see their credentials just by entering the Id number. Holders also can share
and unshare their credentials to any third party. Third parties can see the credentials of the
holders when access is provided by holders, just by entering the Id number of the holderâ€™s
credentials.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
